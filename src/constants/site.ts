export const SITE_DESCRIPTION =
  "Nestled in the heart of bayou country, Swamp Cafe brings the vibrant flavors of Louisiana to your table. Our chefs craft each dish with locally sourced ingredients, time-honored Cajun techniques, and a modern twist that celebrates the rich culinary heritage of the South.";
export const SITE_ABOUT_INTRO =
  "Chef David spent over 30 years in New Orleans, starting as a busboy in Metairie, working his way up through the kitchen, and falling in love with the bold, soulful flavors of Cajun and Creole cooking. When he moved to Dallas, he couldn't find the taste of home anywhere. So he built it himself. From rich gumbos and étouffées to beignets that rival Cafe Du Monde's, Swamp Café brings authentic NOLA soul to North Texas.";
export const SITE_ABOUT_BODY =
  "Swamp Café is more than a family restaurant. It's a piece of New Orleans, our home. The walls are lined with signed Jazz Fest posters, newspapers from the night the Saints won the Super Bowl, and license plates off our old cars back in Louisiana. A place where every dish and every detail carries the same warmth, tradition, and love that makes NOLA feel like home, no matter how far you are from it.";
